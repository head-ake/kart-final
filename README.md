to get the model run
`wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8.2.0/yolov8n.pt`
and place the downloaded file in the data directory

`pip install ultralytics` 

if you want to write test code for the printer put it in the `if __init__ = '__main__'` block and it'll run with `python3 printer.py`
